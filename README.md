Hello! If you're here from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), check out [my repository](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code) which contains most of my solutions as I wrote them during the contest. You may also be interested in my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino), where I cover some of my solutions for AoC challenges.

I am active on Stack Exchange, particularly Code Golf ([link to my profile](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/68942/hyper-neutrino)).

You can join my discord server, [The Particle Collider](https://discord.gg/j9uunTRRJm).
